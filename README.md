# oss-bof-repo1

This project is an experiment to create a collaborative summary of the
eResearch NZ 2022 BoF **OSS Development Dos and Don'ts** using (somewhat
simplified) open source development methods.

Attendee prerequisite for active participation: a GitHub account.

## BoF Plan

### 1. Explain the Experiment
  - Short introductions; then we will try to:
  - Decide some relevant topics of interest
  - Create Issues on the repository for each topic
  - Add Issue comments to record the discussion and any conclusions
  - Make Pull Requests to update the summary document and close Issues
     - via the GitHub UI (easy: demo)
     - (or for experts offline, by working with `git` and your own repo fork)
  - Discuss (the BoF topic and this experiment!) and Wrap Up
     

### 2. Breakout Rooms

  - Choose one or more topics of interest
  - Create associated Issues on the repository, one per topic
     https://github.com/OSS-BOF-eResearch-2022/oss-bof-repo1/issues
  - Debate topics and record anything important in Issue comments
  - If time, attempt to make a Pull Request to address and close one of your Issues by
    updating the summary document
      https://github.com/OSS-BOF-eResearch-2022/oss-bof-repo1/blob/main/bof-summary.md
     - Trivial changes (e.g. to fix a typo or change formatting) can also be made, just for practice!
  - Nominate someone to summarise what your group discussed and did

### 4. Back Together 

  - Rep from each group to summarise discussion and activity
  - If no one managed a Pull Request, demo one live
  - Demo review and PR merge, to update the document and close one Issue

### Wrap Up
  - What did we learn? (about *OSS Development Dos and Don'ts*)
  - What worked well, what not so well? (in this experiment!)
  - Was this an interesting experience (whether successful or not!)
  - **Follow-up**: encourage continued addition and update of Issues and Pull Requests over
     coming weeks, to see what if we can end up with a useful document!
