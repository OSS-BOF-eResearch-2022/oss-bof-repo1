# oss-bof-repo1

This project is an experiment to create a collaborative summary of the
eResearch NZ 2022 BoF
**OSS Development Dos and Don'ts**
Using (somewhat simplified) Open Source development methods.

**Attendee prerequisite for active participation:** a GitHub account.

## BoF Agenda

### 1. Introduction
  - Short introductions
  - Explain the process, demo making a change to address an issue
  - (Note the experiment in document creation is of secondary importance to the
    BoF topic)

### 2. All
  - Consider what topics are, or may be, of interest to attendees

### 3. Breakout rooms
  - Discuss selected topics (and/or think of additional ones)
  - [Create Issues on the
    repository](https://github.com/OSS-BOF-eResearch-2022/oss-bof-repo1/issues),
    one per topic
  - Debate topics and record discussion points in Issue comments
  - If time permits, make a Pull Request (PR) to update [the document](
      https://github.com/OSS-BOF-eResearch-2022/oss-bof-repo1/blob/main/bof-summary.md)
      and (once merged) close one of your Issues
     - Via the GitHub UI (easy: demo)
     - (OR for experts, offline, with `git` and your own repo fork)
  - Trivial changes (e.g. to fix a typo or change formatting) can also be
      made, for practice!
 
### 4. All
  - Rep from each group to summarise discussion and activity
  - If no one managed a PR, quickly demo one live
  - Demo PR review and merge, to close an Issue

### 5. Wrap Up
  - What did we learn? (about *OSS Development Dos and Don'ts*)
  - What worked well, what not so well? (in this experiment!)
  - Was this an interesting experience (whether successful or not!)
  - **Follow-up**: encourage continued addition and update of Issues and PRs
    over coming weeks, to see if we can end up with a useful document!
